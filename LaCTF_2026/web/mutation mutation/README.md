#### Notes / Intuition
- This app was an excersize in debugging js in browser.

#### Solution
- Loaded the target page which says `All you need to do is inspect this page!`.
- Hit F-12 to load the dev tools.
- Checked the `Elements` tab to view some pretty crazy DOM manipulations occurring.
	- What I see looks like a bunch of different flag possibilities appearing, disappearing, etc very fast
- I clicked over to the `Sources` tab and hit the `Pause` button.
- I clicked back over to the `Elements` tab where the DOM manipulation had stopped and only one of the possible flags looked valid.
